## AI Agents

MedMRI AI uses specialized AI agents built on Google Gemini to handle various aspects of MRI analysis:

- **Radiologist Agent** – Analyzes the uploaded MRI image to detect anatomical regions and abnormalities.
- **Report Generator Agent** – Structures the findings into a medically coherent report.
- **Medical Explainer Agent** – Converts clinical findings into simplified patient-friendly language.
- **(Optional) Patient Assistant Agent** – Interacts with user questions and helps explain suggested actions.

These agents collaborate in sequence for every MRI image, allowing the application to deliver accurate, explainable, and actionable medical results.
